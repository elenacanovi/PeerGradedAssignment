NOTE: given the [requirements of the assignment](https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-cleaning/peer/FIZtT/getting-and-cleaning-data-course-project) and following the [David Hood's advice] (https://thoughtfulbloke.wordpress.com/2015/09/09/getting-and-cleaning-the-assignment/) I ignored the files in the folders test/Inertial\ Signals and train/Inertial\ Signals and directly used test/X_test.txt and train/X_train.txt
